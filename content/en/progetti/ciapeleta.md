## 🏡 Description

Official website of **La Ciapéleta Farmhouse**, a wonderful agriturismo with panoramic sea views in Ventimiglia (IM), Italy.

Built with **Hugo** and custom HTML/CSS, the site is **lightweight, fast, and user-friendly** — perfect even for hillside areas with limited connectivity. Each section was designed to reflect the authentic atmosphere of the property, using warm visuals and clear, welcoming text.

It features pages about rooms, restaurant, contact info, and booking.  
The design is minimalist yet cozy, aligned with the visual identity of the farmhouse.
