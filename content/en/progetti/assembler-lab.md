## 🛠️ Description

Complete redesign of the official website of **Assembler Computer**, an IT workshop and technical support center based in Cuneo, Italy.

The project was born from the need to replace an outdated static structure — both visually and technically — and build a modern, solid, and easily maintainable foundation.

The new website was developed using **Hugo**, with fully custom code, prioritizing:

- service clarity  
- immediate navigation  
- visual consistency with Assembler Studio  
- high performance  
- simple and efficient management  

The structure is essential and focused:  
About, Services, Contact.

No unnecessary complexity.  
Only what matters — built properly.
