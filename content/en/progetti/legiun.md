## 🛏️ Description

Official website of **La Legiun Straniera**, a cozy holiday home nestled in the hills of **Fontanelle di Boves** (CN), Italy.

Built using the **Namecheap Page Builder**, the project was developed under a **minimal budget** but with maximum attention to aesthetics and accessibility. The site features a **clean layout**, **multilingual support (IT/EN/FR)**, and clear sections for guests to explore the location, discover the rooms, and access external booking platforms.

Despite the simplicity of the underlying tool, the project reflects the **Assembler approach**: fast, lightweight, and visually curated.
